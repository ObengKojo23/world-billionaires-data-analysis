---
### 5.14 In what day of the month are most billionaires born‚ùì
![](./images/5.14.png)
####  üîçFindings

**Birth Date Distribution**:
   - The highest number of billionaires are born on the `1st` of the month, with a total of `695 billionaires`.
   - Conversely, the `31st` day has the least number of billionaires, with only `24 billionaires` born.
   - The distribution for the remaining days of the month varies between `54` and `72 billionaires`.

**Possible Reasons for highest number on the 1st and lowest on the 31st**

- **Higher Births on the 1st**:
  - **Cultural and Societal Factors**: The 1st of the month may have cultural significance in many societies, often associated with new beginnings, making it a popular time for families to welcome new children. The notion of starting fresh with the month can also lead to increased emotional and psychological motivations for families to conceive and give birth around this time.
  - **Planned Births**: Many parents may intentionally plan for their child's birth to occur at the beginning of the month, especially if they desire their child to start school at the beginning of the academic year or have a birthday that aligns with the start of the month.
  - **Medical Scheduling**: Hospitals might have scheduling patterns that favor elective births (like induced labor or C-sections) at the beginning of the month, particularly for financial reasons, such as meeting insurance or payment cycles.
  
- **Lower Births on the 31st**:
  - **Fewer Days in the Month**: The 31st day occurs less frequently in the year than other days, as not every month has 31 days. This naturally results in fewer birthdays on this date.
  - **Statistical Anomaly**: The 31st may also be subject to statistical anomalies, where it could be a day less favored for scheduling births, leading to a lower count compared to other days.

### 5.16 Is there a correlation between a country‚Äôs economic indicator, Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the number of billionaires it has‚ùì
![](./images/5.16.png)
![](./images/5.16b.png)
#### üîçFindings
- **Weak Negative Correlation**: The correlation coefficient of `-0.05` indicates a very weak negative relationship between CPI and the number of billionaires, suggesting that changes in CPI do not strongly predict the number of billionaires in a country.
- **P-Value Insights**: The p-value of `0.48231` indicates that the observed correlation is not statistically significant, implying that there is no meaningful relationship between CPI and billionaire count in this dataset.
- **Implications**: These findings suggest that factors other than CPI may play a more significant role in the accumulation of wealth and the presence of billionaires in a country, such as economic policies, investment climate, or social conditions.

### 5.17 Is there a correlation between a country‚Äôs economic indicator, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the number of billionaires it has‚ùì
![](./images/5.17.png)
![](./images/5.17b.png)
####  üîçFindings
- **Positive Correlation**: The correlation coefficient of `0.15` indicates a weak positive relationship between GDP and the number of billionaires. This suggests that, as GDP increases, the number of billionaires tends to rise, albeit the relationship is not strong.
- **Statistical Significance**: The p-value of `0.03962` indicates that the correlation is statistically significant at the 5% level, implying that there is a meaningful association between GDP and the billionaire count.
- **Economic Implications**: These findings suggest that countries with larger economies (higher GDP) are likely to have more billionaires, highlighting the influence of economic prosperity on wealth accumulation. However, the weak correlation indicates that GDP alone is not a definitive predictor of billionaire presence, and other factors may also be at play.
