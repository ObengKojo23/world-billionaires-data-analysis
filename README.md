<a href=#cont>Back to Project Structure</a>

### 1.1 Project Overview üìù
This project aims to explore various aspects of the global billionaire population using a dataset of billionaires, including their demographic details, wealth, and geographical distribution. The focus is on understanding how factors such as gender, age, region, and wealth type correlate with the concentration of billionaires worldwide. Additional insights include trends in self-made versus inherited wealth, birth month distributions, and the relationship between economic indicators and the number of billionaires in a country.


### 1.2 Objective üéØ

To deliver a data-driven analysis that uncovers patterns and trends in global wealth distribution among billionaires. The objective is to identify key characteristics that distinguish self-made versus inherited wealth, understand how demographics and economic indicators correlate with billionaire populations, and examine the factors contributing to the concentration of wealth in certain regions and industries. This project aims to offer actionable insights into the global wealth landscape and the forces shaping it by answering these underlisted 17 questions.

1. *What is the distribution of billionaires by gender?*
2. *How is wealth distributed among self-made billionaires compared to those who inherited their wealth?*
3. *Which countries and cities have the highest concentration of billionaires?*
4. *What is the age distribution of billionaires?*
5. *Which industries do most billionaires belong to?*
6. *What are the most common sources of wealth for billionaires?*
7. *How is the net worth of billionaires distributed globally?*
8. *What percentage of billionaires are self-made versus inherited?*
9. *How does the billionaire population correlate with economic indicators such as GDP and CPI?*
10. *Is there a relationship between population size and the number of billionaires in a country?*
11. *How does the age of billionaires correlate with their net worth?*
12. *Which countries have the highest number of self-made billionaires?*
13. *What is the distribution of billionaires by birth month?*
14. *Is there a noticeable difference in the number of billionaires by gender in different industries?*
15. *Which organizations or companies are most frequently associated with billionaires?*
16. *What trends can be observed in the wealth accumulation of younger versus older billionaires?*
17. *How has the number of billionaires evolved over time, particularly in key industries?*

## **üîÑ 2. Data Processing and Preparation**
<a href=#cont>Back to Project Structure</a>

For the data processing and preparation for this project I employed several steps to ensure consistency, accuracy, and usability of the dataset. Here‚Äôs a summary of the transformations I applied:

- **Column Formatting**:
   - All column names were standardized to lowercase, and spaces were replaced with underscores for easier access and consistency.

- **Data Type Conversion**:
   - The `gdp_country` column had dollar signs (`$`) and commas removed, and the data type was converted to `float` to support numerical analysis.
   - Similarly, the `finalworth` column had the dollar sign and "B" (billion) symbol removed and was converted to a float, assuming figures are in billions.

- **Date Formatting**:
   - The `date` column was converted to a datetime format and displayed as `MM/DD/YYYY` for consistency in date representation.

- **Column Renaming**:
   - Key columns were renamed for clarity and consistency, such as changing `personname` to `full_name` and `countryofcitizenship` to `country_of_citizenship`.


- **Month Conversion**:
   - A dictionary was created to convert numeric month values (1 to 12) to their corresponding three-letter month abbreviations (e.g., `1` to `Jan`). This was applied to the `birth_month` column to improve readability.

- **Handling Missing Values**:
   - For specified columns (`country`, `title`, `organization`, `residence_state_region`, `state`), missing values were filled with "Unknown" to avoid issues with null data during analysis and to maintain data completeness.

- **Region Mapping**:
   - A dictionary was created to map each country to its respective region (e.g., `France` to `Europe`, `India` to `Asia`). A new column, `region`, was added based on the `country_of_citizenship` column, providing a broader regional context for each billionaire's country.

These data cleaning steps resulted in a well-structured dataset ready for full analysis and visualisation.

---
### 3.14 In what day of the month are most billionaires born‚ùì
![](./images/5.14.png)
####  üåüKey Insights

**Birth Date Distribution**:
   - The highest number of billionaires are born on the `1st` of the month, with a total of `695 billionaires`.
   - Conversely, the `31st` day has the least number of billionaires, with only `24 billionaires` born.
   - The distribution for the remaining days of the month varies between `54` and `72 billionaires`.

**Possible Reasons for highest number on the 1st and lowest on the 31st**

- **Higher Births on the 1st**:
  - **Cultural and Societal Factors**: The 1st of the month may have cultural significance in many societies, often associated with new beginnings, making it a popular time for families to welcome new children. The notion of starting fresh with the month can also lead to increased emotional and psychological motivations for families to conceive and give birth around this time.
  - **Planned Births**: Many parents may intentionally plan for their child's birth to occur at the beginning of the month, especially if they desire their child to start school at the beginning of the academic year or have a birthday that aligns with the start of the month.
  - **Medical Scheduling**: Hospitals might have scheduling patterns that favor elective births (like induced labor or C-sections) at the beginning of the month, particularly for financial reasons, such as meeting insurance or payment cycles.
  
- **Lower Births on the 31st**:
  - **Fewer Days in the Month**: The 31st day occurs less frequently in the year than other days, as not every month has 31 days. This naturally results in fewer birthdays on this date.
  - **Statistical Anomaly**: The 31st may also be subject to statistical anomalies, where it could be a day less favored for scheduling births, leading to a lower count compared to other days.

- **Absence in Africa**: Notably, there are `no young billionaires` in Africa, suggesting a significant gap in youth wealth accumulation compared to other regions.
- **Implications**: These trends may reflect differences in economic opportunities, educational access, and entrepreneurial ecosystems across regions, providing insights for policymakers and investors looking to support young wealth creators.

---
### 3.16 Is there a correlation between a country‚Äôs economic indicator, Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the number of billionaires it has‚ùì
![](./images/5.16.png)
![](./images/5.16b.png)
#### üåüKey Insights
- **Weak Negative Correlation**: The correlation coefficient of `-0.05` indicates a very weak negative relationship between CPI and the number of billionaires, suggesting that changes in CPI do not strongly predict the number of billionaires in a country.
- **P-Value Insights**: The p-value of `0.48231` indicates that the observed correlation is not statistically significant, implying that there is no meaningful relationship between CPI and billionaire count in this dataset.
- **Implications**: These findings suggest that factors other than CPI may play a more significant role in the accumulation of wealth and the presence of billionaires in a country, such as economic policies, investment climate, or social conditions.
  
.

### 3.17 Is there a correlation between a country‚Äôs economic indicator, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the number of billionaires it has‚ùì
![](./images/5.17.png)
![](./images/5.17b.png)
####  üåüKey Insights
- **Positive Correlation**: The correlation coefficient of `0.15` indicates a weak positive relationship between GDP and the number of billionaires. This suggests that, as GDP increases, the number of billionaires tends to rise, albeit the relationship is not strong.
- **Statistical Significance**: The p-value of `0.03962` indicates that the correlation is statistically significant at the 5% level, implying that there is a meaningful association between GDP and the billionaire count.
- **Economic Implications**: These findings suggest that countries with larger economies (higher GDP) are likely to have more billionaires, highlighting the influence of economic prosperity on wealth accumulation. However, the weak correlation indicates that GDP alone is not a definitive predictor of billionaire presence, and other factors may also be at play.
