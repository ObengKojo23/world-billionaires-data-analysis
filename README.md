### üåç Introduction

This analysis explores various aspects of the global billionaire population using a dataset of billionaires, including their demographic details, wealth, and geographical distribution.

- **Non-Graphical Analysis**: The first step of the EDA involves looking at summary statistics, null values, and unique values for various columns to get an understanding of the data structure and potential cleaning needs.
  
- **Graphical Analysis**: Visuals such as bar plots, pie charts, and histograms are used to uncover trends in billionaire distribution by gender, age, wealth source, and geographical region.

- **Wealth Distribution**: Analysis of net worth reveals significant disparities between self-made and inherited billionaires.
- **Geographic Focus**: Certain countries and cities are home to a disproportionately large number of billionaires, providing insights into global wealth concentration.
- **Demographics**: Trends in gender and age distribution show that most billionaires fall within specific age brackets, and self-made wealth is more common among younger billionaires.
